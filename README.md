# RAM-Interpreter
A C++ program to interpret RAM (random-access machine) -- a computational model introduced in the book "Computational Complexity" by Ch. H. Papadimitriou

# Instructions
1. Compile all .cpp files using a standard C++ compiler.
2. Write your RAM program using an ordinary text editor, and save it as a .txt file (file name other than 'input.txt' or 'output.txt' suggested).
3. If your RAM program consumes input parameters, then create a file named 'input.txt' that contains them, separated by space.
4. Run the executable file, and do as prompted.
5. The output of your RAM program, i.e., the value of Register 0, is stored into 'output.txt'.

# Note
'MULT.txt' is a sample RAM program that performs multiplication of integers (a sample 'input.txt' is provided).
